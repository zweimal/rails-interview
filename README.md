# rails-interview — a sample Ruby on Rails app for potential hires

## Introduction

Hi!  Thanks for your interest in joining the team.  This README will guide you
through completing our interview application.  While completing this
application, you'll get a bit of exposure to testing and completing a basic
Rails controller.

The app doesn't do much now, and has failing tests.  Your job is to complete
the application such that the views are populated with data, the tests pass,
and all requested functionality is completed.

After that you'll get the chance to show us how you'd implement the same
functionality in JavaScript if you were tasked with building a
single-page application.

Have fun with the challenge!  When you're done, please link your contact person
to your forked repository on GitHub.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the [rails-interview](http://github.com/ImagineLearning/rails-interview)
   repository on GitHub.
1. `clone` it locally to your machine
1. `cd` into the directory
1. Run `bundle install` to install gems
1. Run `bin\rails server`
1. Browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/students)

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have version `2.3` or higher of `ruby` installed on your machine.
1. Ensure you have `bundler` installed (`gem install bundler`)
1. Ensure you have `git` installed on your machine

### Fork and Clone rails-interview

1. Fork the [rails-interview](http://github.com/ImagineLearning/rails-interview)
   repository on GitHub.
1. `clone` it locally to your machine
1. When done, push your changes up to your fork

## Solving the Problem - Ruby on Rails / TDD
This will run the tests as defined and report any errors making use of predefined fixtures.

We have given you some failing tests to try to fix.  We've also provided you
with some predefined fixture data to utilize.  As you implement your
Rails controller, you'll see the tests start to turn green.

You can run the tests by running

```
rake test
```

from the command line in the application directory.

Once all of your tests are passing, please move on to the JavaScript portion of
the application.

## Solving the Problem - JavaScript / SPA

Once you've completed the Rails portion of the application, you then get to use
a bit of creativity to implement that same page, but in JavaScript as a
single-page application.  You may use any of the following frameworks:

1. Backbone with or without Marionette
1. AngularJS 1.x
1. ReactJS

We have several JavaScript applications in production with a few different
frameworks, so this part is important to us.  Structure this JS
application in a way that you find simple and easy to understand.

You may utilize a Rails view to load the header of the page, an entry point
DOM element, any JS templates
(ex. `<script type="text/template" id="someTpl">DOM TEMPLATE IN HERE</script>`)
and any extra JavaScript files you need to load.  All templates should be
loaded from the JavaScript side, not rendered by Rails.

### Tasks

1. Allow `/students` to return JSON using headers. (Don't use `/students.json`)
1. Add a nested collection route named `:js` to the `:students` resource
1. Create a corresponding `js` method in the `StudentsController`
1. Return a view from `/students/js` that will load a single-page application version
   of `/students` and fulfill the constraints listed above.
  1. SPA should only load everything below the `h1` header with front-end views
  1. The JavaScript code should trigger the rendering of the rest of the page.
1. SPA should have all functionality of `/students` with:
  - Sorting by clicking on table headers
  - Filtering by name with a text input just above the table
1. SPA should only make JSON AJAX calls to `/students`
  - Must use Promises (native, jQuery, $q, etc) for AJAX requests
  - Must implement successful case when API responds properly
  - Must implement unsuccessful case when API fails to respond
